# Medium Clone

A clone of Medium built using modern web technologies. The project includes a React frontend, a Cloudflare Workers backend, and a PostgreSQL database. It uses TypeScript for type safety, Prisma as the ORM with connection pooling, Zod for validation, and JWT for authentication.

## Tech Stack
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **Zod**: A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library for validation and type inference.
- **Cloudflare Workers**: A serverless platform for building scalable applications.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **Prisma**: An ORM for Node.js and TypeScript that provides a type-safe database client.
- **PostgreSQL**: An open-source relational database.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: A standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

### Deployment
- **Frontend**: Deployed on Vercel.
- **Backend**: Deployed on Cloudflare Workers.

P.S. The ffrontend really sucks as I hate react & styling..

Good bye!
